Engineering College Automation Process is a software that helps both the 
students and the management authorities of the college. Our Engineering College 
Automation Process is capable of storing the details of the students and the teachers 
and also maintain their details in a dynamic order. This software can help us explore 
all the activities happening inside the college which we as students do not have any 
knowledge about. It can handle the details of students, teachers and head of the 
departments. In this system the admin can maintain every detail of a particular student 
in their college. Engineering College Automation Process Project will also help the
